After your workspace is built and sourced:

rosrun teraranger one _portname:=/dev/ttyACM0

seeing availible ports: ls /dev/tty*

in the terminal you run it in, you may get the following error:
[ERROR] [1518579060.318374119]: Timeout or error while reading serial

not sure why, but

if you: rostopic echo /teraranger_one
you should still see the data stream
